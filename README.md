# AI-Driven Livestock Health Monitoring System

This project explores the application of AI and machine learning techniques for early detection and prevention of livestock diseases. It focuses on integrating sensor data and computer vision to monitor animal health conditions in real-time.

## Objectives
- Detect early symptoms of common livestock diseases using AI models
- Reduce disease spread and treatment costs through early intervention
- Improve data collection and monitoring in rural farming environments

## Approach
- Collect data from sensors (e.g., temperature, heart rate) and camera feeds
- Train ML models for anomaly detection and symptom classification
- Use cloud dashboards or mobile alerts for real-time monitoring

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebooks
- OpenCV for image processing
- Pandas/Numpy for data handling

## Status
This is a concept-stage project, with current focus on:
- Data sourcing strategies
- Building proof-of-concept models
- Exploring low-cost deployment options

This project was originally developed as part of an AI research concept to promote data-driven livestock health solutions in Sub-Saharan Africa.
