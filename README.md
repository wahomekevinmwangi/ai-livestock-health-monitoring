# 🐄 AI-Driven Livestock Health Monitoring

An intelligent system for early disease detection in livestock using machine learning and key physiological parameters.

---

## 📌 Project Goal

To build a machine learning pipeline capable of detecting early signs of livestock illness using data such as:

- Body temperature
- Heart rate
- Respiratory rate

---

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing
- SMOTE for imbalance handling
- Model training with Random Forest & GridSearchCV
- Performance evaluation (precision, recall, F1-score)
- Confusion matrix visualization

---

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

- Integration with IoT sensor streams
- Image-based detection using deep learning
- Specific disease classification
- GPS-based livestock tracking
