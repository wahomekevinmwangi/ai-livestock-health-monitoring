# AI-Driven Livestock Health Monitoring System

This project explores the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect livestock diseases early through sensor data and computer vision. The goal is to improve animal health management by enabling timely intervention and reducing disease-related losses in agriculture.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Early detection of livestock diseases remains a major challenge in agriculture, especially in resource-constrained settings. Traditional monitoring methods are labor-intensive and often reactive. This system aims to automate disease detection using real-time data from biosensors and camera feeds.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Monitor livestock health through wearable sensors and cameras
- Detect early symptoms of disease using ML algorithms
- Alert farmers via a dashboard or mobile notification
- Reduce veterinary costs and improve productivity

## 🛠️ Technical Approach
- **Data Sources:** Vital signs (temperature, heart rate), behavioral video data
- **Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, normalization, outlier detection
- **Modeling:** Anomaly detection and classification (ML & CV models)
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, OpenCV, Scikit-learn/TensorFlow

## 🧪 Current Progress
- Drafted system architecture and workflows
- Identified relevant ML techniques for disease detection
- Exploring public datasets and prototype data collection strategies

## 📊 Future Steps
- Simulate data for training models
- Build baseline classification model
- Design a simple web dashboard for alerts

## 📂 Project Structure
- `/slides` – Concept presentation (.pptx/.pdf)
- `/notebooks` – Jupyter notebooks (planned)
- `/data` – Placeholder for datasets
- `/docs` – Future technical documentation

This project was originally developed as a concept note and presentation to explore AI-based solutions for agricultural health monitoring in Sub-Saharan Africa. It continues to evolve as a learning and applied research project.
